# DeepMind Educational Resources

This repository contains a collection of educational resources that we have
prepared for teaching the basics of machine learning to younger audiences. The
goal is to have simple and accessible resources that can enable anyone with no
machine learning background to engage and learn from these tutorials.

Our aim is to contribute to democratisation of machine learning by providing
accessible educational resources to inspire younger generations.

## Tutorials

These tutorials are presented as notebooks that can be launched via
Google Colab.

### Fluttering Avians [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/deepmind/educational/blob/master/colabs/fluttering_avians.ipynb)

Videogames and artificial intelligence have a long and happy history together. In this tutorial we will play a familiar (and hard!) game, learn what an agent is, and how we can make them learn to play the game with superhuman abilities. The agents we will build are evaluated on their performance on the game, and selected with variation in a virtual circle of life inspired by evolution.

### Fun with Language [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/deepmind/educational/blob/master/colabs/fun_with_language.ipynb)

This tutorial shows how we can build important artificial intelligence models for natural language processing called language models. Language models are surprisingly effective models that learn to predict the next letter (or word) given previous letters (or words) --- they essentially learn which letters (or words) go well together. In this tutorial we teach you how the computer represents and processes language, and show how we can use a big chunk of text to learn language models and apply them on two tasks: decoding secret messages and generating text.

### Generative Models [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/deepmind/educational/blob/master/colabs/generative_models.ipynb)

Creativity is central to human intelligence. In this tutorial we see where Artificial Intelligence (AI) meets creativity. We will show you how an AI can produce realistic looking images of everyday objects as well as works-of-art and imagine "spider-dogs". We refer to an AI that is able to do any one of these things as Generative Models and towards the end of this tutorial you will build your own one.

### Protein Folding  [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/deepmind/educational/blob/master/colabs/protein_folding.ipynb)

This tutorial explores the use of machine learning for solving the protein
structure prediction problem. Although the tutorial does not actually solve the
problem itself, it provides students with very basic background in coding
and biology to get started, and trains their intuition on machine learning
methods, with the help of visualisation and a few examples of folding simple
protein structures.

### Basics of Reinforcement Learning [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/deepmind/educational/blob/master/colabs/reinforcement_learning.ipynb)

This tutorial introduces students to a simple reinforcement learning (RL) setup
used in research. It involves running pre-existing code to set up an RL
environment and visualise it. Students can then look at how a completely random
(untrained) agent behaves in these environments. We also include simple code
that implements a reinforcement learning method that can train the agent to
solve these simple tasks. The behaviour of the trained agent can be then
visualised together with plots of how the agent evolves through training.

### Scientific Thinking [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/deepmind/educational/blob/master/colabs/scientific_thinking.ipynb)

This tutorial teaches you the basic ideas that underline scientific thinking. We cover developing and testing new knowledge with the scientific method through experimentation and validation, while showing common pitfalls in the process. Through a series of games you will play as an agent trying to understand the world, you will get insight into some of the core ideas behind scientific thinking.
